I am **Chenxi Li**, a prospective Ph.D. student in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)**, starting in **September 2025**. I received my Bachelor's degree in *Management Sciences in Big Data Management and Application* from HIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Guangxin Jiang**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/jiangguangxin) during both my undergraduate and upcoming doctoral studies.

In addition, I worked as a short-term **Research Assistant** at **City University of Hong Kong**, under the guidance of [**Prof. Qiushuang**](https://shq-ml.github.io/#publication) and [**Prof. Siyang Gao**](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/siyangao.htm).

My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **chronic disease management**, and **simulation-based optimization**, with a focus on data-driven decision-making in healthcare and operations management.

Feel free to reach me via email: **ling112358@gmail.com**
