I am **Chenxi Li**, a prospective Ph.D. student in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)**, starting in **September 2025**. I received my Bachelor's degree in *Management Sciences in Big Data Management and Application* from HIT, where I was fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Guangxin Jiang**](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/jiangguangxin) during both my undergraduate and upcoming doctoral studies.

In addition, from April 2025 to August 2025, I worked as a **Research Assistant** at **City University of Hong Kong**, under the guidance of [**Prof. Siyang Gao**](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/siyangao.htm) and [**Prof. Shuang Qiu**](https://shq-ml.github.io/#publication).

My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **chronic disease management**, and **simulation optimization**.
